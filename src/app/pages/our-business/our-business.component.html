                Mizar Eridanus Energy has therefore chosen to commit its resources to the establishment of a 25, 000 mpd refinery in
                Namibia. With further interests in Marginal fields across Africa.
                The decision to establish a 25, 000 mpd modular refinery in Namibia was concluded after detailed preminilary survey was
                conducted by our project partner in Namibia. Recently, the government and state officials of Namibia through an
                aggressive campaign are engaging private investors to invest in the oil sector of the economy in Namibia since the
                discovery of oil. Namibia with no refining capacity therefore imports all her refined oil products from South Africa.
                The Refinery will be setup in Erongo Region between Swakopmund and Walvis Bay on Bakersville new town development 12km
                away from sea level/sea port. Namibia uses about 1,350,800,000 (1.35Billion liters of Fuel per year).
                Namibia being a logistical hub for land locked countries such Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, DRC and other interested
                States. The refinery will be able to supply Botswana, and other neighboring SADC countries, such as DRC, Zimbabwe and
                Zambia
